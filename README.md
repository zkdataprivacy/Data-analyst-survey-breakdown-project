# Data Analysis Project: Data Professional Survey

This project revolves around an in-depth analysis of a survey conducted among data professionals, sourced from a YouTube video by Alex. While Alex presented a guided project based on this survey, this project takes it a step further by implementing additional data cleaning techniques and comprehensive analysis.

## Data Cleaning Process

The initial dataset, retrieved from Alex's YouTube video, underwent extensive cleaning to enhance its usability. While attempting to clean columns like 'current industry,' 'country name,' and 'current role,' various tools were employed. Initially, Bard AI was attempted but deemed ineffective. The cleaning process was successfully executed with ChatGPT's assistance. In the Power Query Editor, a new 'age group' column was added, and the 'country name' column was merged with data from another worksheet to ensure clean country data.

## PowerBI Analysis Overview

The survey data was transformed into three distinct and informative worksheets:

### 1. Data Professional Happiness Index (Interactive Dashboard)
This section displays the happiness metrics of survey respondents, encompassing aspects like salary satisfaction, work-life balance, collaboration with coworkers, and more.

## Challenges Faced

The primary challenge was ensuring data cleanliness, particularly when respondent answers did not adhere to column criteria. Excel and Power BI's query editor were pivotal in handling the heavy lifting during the data cleaning phase.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis highlighted key trends among data professionals. It revealed a significant trend where many individuals transitioned into data analysis without direct background experience. Python emerged as the preferred programming language, with a majority of respondents hailing from the United States. The average age of respondents was around 30, and overall, most data analysis professionals expressed moderate satisfaction across the survey metrics.
